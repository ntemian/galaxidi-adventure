# Galaxidi Adventure — Expansion Ideas

## 1. Digital Twin of Galaxidi

- Recreate the real town of Galaxidi as a navigable game world
- Accurate streets, landmarks, harbor, churches, hills
- Seasonal variations (summer light, winter storms)
- Day/night cycle reflecting real-world time or in-game time
- Historical layers — show how the town looked in different eras

## 2. More Characters & Custom Adventures

- Expand the cast: fishermen, shopkeepers, tourists, historical figures
- Each character with their own backstory and side quests
- Branching dialogue trees with relationship tracking
- Player choices affect character attitudes and story outcomes
- Modular adventure system — plug in new storylines without rewriting core

## 3. Time Element & Forks

- Time-based mechanics: events happen at specific in-game hours
- Missed opportunities — if you don't act in time, the story branches differently
- Multiple endings based on accumulated choices
- Fork points clearly (or subtly) signaled to the player
- Replayability through divergent paths and hidden branches

## 4. Supernatural Elements

- Ghost ships in the harbor at night
- Ancient spirits tied to Galaxidi's maritime history
- Mythological creatures from Greek folklore (Nereids, sea monsters)
- Cursed artifacts that alter gameplay mechanics
- Thin boundary between real and supernatural — player uncertain what's real
- Prophecies and omens woven into puzzles
