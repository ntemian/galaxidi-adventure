## ΝΤΕΜΗΣ / NTEMIS LATSOUDIS

**Age:** 47 | **Role:** Player character, party leader | **Game skill:** Logic, persuasion, documents

### Who He Is

A lawyer by profession, a philosopher by nature. Ntemis runs Latsoudis Law — corporate work, precise, detail-oriented. But his real mind lives elsewhere: in questions about meaning, in the music of Dead Can Dance and Camel, in long evenings reading about ancient civilizations while drinking espresso number five of the day.

He's 1.84m, broad-shouldered, built like someone who used to be athletic and now carries his strength differently. He walks with purpose. He talks in structured arguments even when ordering coffee. His kids tease him for it.

### His Galaxidi

Galaxidi is Ntemis's anchor place — **Το Σπίτι της Γαλήνης και Επανασύνδεσης** (The House of Serenity and Reconnection). The rented stone house is where life slows down, where the espresso tastes better because there's a terrace and a view. He knows the town's history better than most visitors — he's read the books, walked the ruins, talked to the locals. But the game will deepen even his understanding.

He chose Galaxidi deliberately. Not Mykonos, not Santorini. A quiet place with depth. A place where his kids can run free and where history isn't behind a velvet rope — it's in the walls, the bollards, the faces of the fishermen.

### His Fatherhood

Ntemis is a single father. Ajax lives with him permanently. Clio visits biweekly. This shapes everything: he's both parents in one, carrying the weight of structure AND warmth. He overcompensates sometimes — too many rules, then suddenly too much ice cream. The kids have learned to read his moods: espresso number one means planning, espresso number three means he's in a good mood, espresso number five means leave him alone.

He worries about Ajax more than he shows. A 13-year-old boy needs a compass, and Ntemis tries to be that compass through conversation, through shared experiences, through games like this adventure in Galaxidi. He worries about Clio differently — she's sensitive, affectionate, and he wants to make every one of her visits count.

### His Arc in the Game

Ntemis starts the game honoring the past. He's the one who reads the plaques, who recognizes dates, who knows the difference between a brig and a schooner. He's the respectful visitor.

By the end, the captains' story mirrors his own professional life — he's seen law firms that were brilliant at the old way and couldn't adapt to the new. The steamship lesson isn't abstract to him. It's personal. **He's spent his career watching excellence become a trap.**

His final understanding: the captains' pact was their real treasure, not their ships. What you build together survives. What you build alone sinks.

### Voice & Personality

- **Speech pattern:** Complete sentences, slightly formal, occasionally poetic. Softens dramatically when talking to his kids.
- **Humor:** Dry, understated. The dad joke king who pretends he doesn't know he's funny.
- **Catchphrases:**
  - "Ας δούμε..." (Let's see...) — his thinking-out-loud start
  - "Ένα λεπτό, παιδιά." (One moment, kids.) — when he spots something interesting
  - "Αυτό δεν βγαίνει λογικά." (That doesn't add up.) — the lawyer reflex
- **What he notices:** Documents, inscriptions, logical inconsistencies, architectural details
- **What he misses:** The emotional truth that Clio sees instantly

### Dialogue Style (Three Options)

Every major dialogue choice gives the player three approaches:

1. **Ο Προσεκτικός / The Careful One** — methodical, respectful, lawyer mode
2. **Ο Έξυπνος / The Clever One** — witty, perceptive, makes connections others miss
3. **Αυτή που τον Έμπλεξαν τα Παιδιά / The One the Kids Talked Him Into** — impulsive, funny, leads to unexpected discoveries

### Inventory Behavior

Ntemis examines everything before picking it up. He reads labels. He turns things over. If an item has writing, he translates it. He's the party's librarian.

### Key Relationships

- **Ajax:** Proud of his son's curiosity and physical courage, worried about his tendency to act before thinking. Sees himself in Ajax's stubbornness. The terrace conversations between them — man to almost-man — are the game's emotional spine.
- **Clio:** Melts. Completely. Clio is his softness made visible. He tries to be educational with her and she teaches him instead. Her questions are better than his answers.
- **Stavros:** Respects the old fisherman immediately. Two men who understand that bitterness can be a form of love.
- **The Curator:** Finally, someone who speaks his language — facts, dates, context. Their conversation at the museum is two enthusiasts geeking out.
- **Chrysostomos:** The father figure Ntemis didn't know he needed. The old sailor's acceptance of change gives Ntemis permission to stop clinging.

### Music That Defines Him

If Ntemis had a soundtrack, it would be Camel's *The Snow Goose* — instrumental, emotional, building slowly from quiet to soaring. He is the melody that grows richer as you listen.

## ΑΙΑΣ / AJAX LATSOUDIS

**Age:** 13 | **Role:** Physical explorer, the generation the game is for | **Game skill:** Climbing, swimming, reaching inaccessible places

### Who He Is

Ajax is named well — he's a warrior in a teenager's body. Member of South Basket B.C. Alimos, swimmer, cyclist, SUP rider. He's the kid who sees a wall and thinks "I can get over that" before anyone says "don't."

He's social, fiercely loyal to his friends (Daniel, Yannis, Lazarus, Stathis, Michalis, Tyler, Mario — his basketball brothers). He has a strong sense of justice, the kind that gets him into trouble because he speaks up when he should probably stay quiet. Mature for 13 — observant, perceptive — but still 13 enough to be impulsive and occasionally sarcastic.

His movie taste tells you everything: Lord of the Rings, Dune, The Goonies, Karate Kid, Good Will Hunting. He loves stories about unlikely heroes who discover something bigger than themselves. **He is living inside one of those stories right now. He just doesn't know it yet.**

### His Galaxidi

For Ajax, Galaxidi is adventure terrain. The harbor wall is for diving off (NTEMIS: "ΑΙΑΝΤΑ!"). The rocks are for climbing. The gulf is for swimming. He sees the town through his body first, his mind second.

But Galaxidi also unlocks something in him. In Athens, he's one of many kids on a basketball court. In Galaxidi, he's a boy discovering that a quiet town holds enormous stories. The scale difference — those oversized bollards, those massive warehouses for a village — confuses and fascinates him. **Why is everything here built too big for what it is now?**

### His Phone

Ajax has a phone and uses it constantly. In the game, this manifests as:
- **Helpful:** He looks up facts, takes photos, maps locations
- **Hilariously wrong:** He misidentifies things based on quick Google searches, autocorrects Greek history into nonsense
- **Genuinely useful:** When he stops Googling and actually listens, his phone becomes a real tool — photographing inscriptions, recording the Curator's stories

The phone is his comfort object. When things get emotionally heavy (the ghost, the vote inscription), he reaches for it. Sometimes he puts it away instead. Those are his growth moments.

### His Arc in the Game

Ajax starts thinking the captains were just cool. Brave sailors, fast ships, respect. He'd have been a captain for sure. Obviously.

At the museum, he learns they were also stubborn. The Curator's line — "Only if you think being the best means you never need to learn something new" — hits him somewhere he didn't expect.

Meeting Eirini outside Liotrivi cracks something open. She's 25, running a tech startup from Galaxidi, and she says the thing nobody else will say: **the captains were great AND wrong.** Not one or the other. Both. Ajax has never considered that your greatest strength can become your greatest weakness. This is genuinely new to him.

By the graveyard, when the ghost shows the vision of the harbor emptying, Ajax isn't just watching history. He's watching what happens when people refuse to change. And for the first time, he's thinking: *what am I refusing to change about?*

His final line — "Τότε ας το κάνουμε" (Then let's do it) — is quiet, thoughtful, and absolutely earned.

### Voice & Personality

- **Speech pattern:** Quick, enthusiastic, slightly breathless. Uses modern slang. Interrupts. Gets louder when excited.
- **Humor:** Sarcastic but never mean. The kind of teenage humor that makes adults try not to laugh.
- **Catchphrases:**
  - "Σοβαρά τώρα;" (Seriously?) — his default reaction to anything historical
  - "Εγώ λέω να πάω να δω." (I say I'll go check it out.) — before doing something physical
  - "Περίμενε — έχω μια ιδέα." (Wait — I have an idea.) — 50/50 whether it's brilliant or disastrous
  - "Ρε, αυτό είναι..." (Dude, this is...) — when something genuinely impresses him
- **What he notices:** Physical details — cracks in walls, paths others miss, things that can be climbed or dived into
- **What he misses:** Emotional subtlety — until Clio or Ntemis point it out

### Dialogue Style

Enthusiastic, occasionally sarcastic, stumbles into wisdom. Ajax says the accidental truth — he blurts out observations that are more profound than he realizes.

His best lines come when he stops performing and speaks from the gut:
- "Δηλαδή... το να είσαι ο καλύτερος σε κάτι μπορεί να σε βλάψει;" (So... being the best at something can hurt you?)
- "Αλλά δεν ήταν αρκετοί." (But they weren't enough.) — about the three captains who voted for steam

### Inventory Behavior

Ajax grabs things. He picks stuff up without asking. He pockets rocks, shells, interesting bits of wood. His inventory is messier than Ntemis's — objects appear that the player didn't deliberately collect. Sometimes this pays off.

### Key Relationships

- **Ntemis:** Loves his dad, thinks he's a bit much sometimes. The terrace conversations are real — Ajax asking questions he wouldn't ask at school, Ntemis answering without the lawyer mask. Ajax is learning how to be a man by watching his father try.
- **Clio:** Protective older brother. Teases her relentlessly but would fight anyone who looked at her wrong. He doesn't realize how much he learns from her questions.
- **Eirini:** The person who changes him. She's young enough to be cool, smart enough to be taken seriously, and she says the thing that lodges in his brain for the rest of the game: "What's the steamship of today?"
- **The Ghost:** The encounter that makes the game personal. The ghost looks at Ajax. Ajax looks at the ghost. Two different futures, separated by 170 years and a decision about steam.

### Food in the Game

Ajax's love of seafood surfaces naturally in Galaxidi:
- At the port, he wants to try everything the fishermen catch
- At dinner scenes, he orders octopus, calamari, anything from the sea
- He's the one who says "μπαμπά, μπορώ να φάω ένα;" about the figs — always hungry, always eating

### Music That Defines Him

If Ajax had a soundtrack, it would be the Cobra Kai theme — energetic, building, with an undercurrent of something more serious beneath the action. He is the beat that drives the adventure forward.

## ΚΛΕΙΩ / CLIO LATSOUDIS

**Age:** 7 | **Role:** The heart, the journal keeper, the one who sees everything | **Game skill:** Observation, drawing, asking devastating questions

### Who She Is

Clio is named after the Muse of History. She doesn't know this is relevant yet. She will.

She's in 1st grade at Maliaras Private School (teacher: Artemis). She's creative, sensitive, affectionate — she loves everyone around her and tells them so, constantly, physically, with hugs that last too long and drawings left on pillows. She's an excellent swimmer, loves ping pong, and can hang on a monkey bar longer than any boy in her class.

She plays Nintendo Switch — Mario, Mario Kart, Kirby, and older games: Bubble Bobble, Double Dragon. She loves the circus (the Cuban National Circus left a permanent impression). She's a Gormiti fan. She eats kiwi and feta cheese with equal enthusiasm.

She's also, underneath the sunshine, a deeply observant and intelligent child. She processes the world through art — drawing is how she understands. Her notebook IS her brain's external drive. When she draws something, she's not just recording it. She's learning it.

### Her Galaxidi

For Clio, Galaxidi is paradise. Cats, sea, stones to collect, flowers to name, everything beautiful. She doesn't see the decline — she sees a magical place where every house has a story and every cat has a secret. Her experience of Galaxidi is **sensory and immediate**: the smell of pine, the warmth of stone, the sound of the sea.

She adopts the harbor cats immediately. She gives them names. The orange one is her favorite. (The orange one, it turns out, always sits on a specific bollard. This becomes relevant.)

### Her Role in the Game

Clio is the game's secret weapon. She asks the questions adults forget. She notices things everyone else walks past. She draws what she sees, and her drawings contain clues that the player needs.

**Her notebook IS the game's journal and inventory log.** When you open the inventory/journal, you see Clio's drawings — rough, colorful, children's art that contains embedded observations. She draws the token and labels it "ΑΛΛΗΛΕΓΓΥΗ — Μπαμπάς λέει σημαίνει μαζί." She draws the harbor and puts too many ships in it because she's copying the old photograph. She draws the ghost and he looks "κουρασμένος αλλά και χαρούμενος."

### Her Arc in the Game

Clio doesn't have a traditional character arc. She doesn't learn the steamship lesson intellectually — she's seven. She can't. But she **feels** it. She senses the sadness in Stavros, the passion in the Curator, the lonely warmth of the ghost. She doesn't understand WHY the harbor is empty, but she feels the emptiness and it moves her.

Her response at the end is the game's emotional climax. It's simple, true, and devastating because it comes from a child who doesn't know she's being profound:

**"Μπαμπά, αν οι καπεταναίοι μπορούσαν να δουν το μέλλον, θα ήθελαν να δοκιμάσουμε κάτι καινούργιο. Σωστά;"**

She's right. She doesn't know how right she is. That's what makes it devastating.

### Voice & Personality

- **Speech pattern:** Short sentences, specific observations, unexpected connections. She speaks in images. She thinks in colors.
- **Humor:** Unintentional. She says things that are funny because they're so honest.
- **Catchphrases:**
  - "Μπαμπά, κοίτα!" (Dad, look!) — her universal alert system
  - "Θα το ζωγραφίσω." (I'll draw it.) — her way of processing anything
  - "Γιατί;" (Why?) — the simple, devastating question she asks more than anyone
  - "Αυτή η γάτα ξέρει κάτι." (That cat knows something.) — she says this about every cat. She might be right.
- **What she notices:** Colors, textures, animals, emotions on faces, small details everyone walks past
- **What she misses:** Abstract concepts — she feels them instead of understanding them

### Dialogue Style

Innocent, specific, devastating. Clio's lines work on two levels:

1. **Surface:** A seven-year-old saying something cute
2. **Depth:** A devastating emotional truth delivered by someone too young to know it's devastating

Her best lines are the ones that make Ntemis pause. When Clio asks "Γιατί σταμάτησαν;" (Why did they stop?), it's a child's question that contains the game's entire thesis.

### Inventory Behavior

Clio collects things that have no obvious use. Shells, flowers, a feather, a cat's whisker. She insists on keeping them. Most are decorative. Some, surprisingly, turn out to be exactly what's needed.

She also draws items when they're found — her notebook sketches serve as visual inventory entries.

### Key Relationships

- **Ntemis:** Her dad is the safest person in the world. She holds his hand without thinking about it. She asks him questions she'd never ask anyone else. She trusts his answers but sometimes corrects them with observations he missed.
- **Ajax:** Adores her big brother, follows him everywhere, annoys him deliberately because his reaction is funny. But she also worries about him in ways she can't articulate — she senses when he's struggling and draws him pictures.
- **The Papas:** A genuine connection. Clio's candle-lighting in the church isn't performative — she really means it. She prays for the captains because they seem lonely.
- **The Ghost:** The most important relationship in the game that has no words. The ghost looks at Clio. Clio looks at the ghost. She waves. He waves back. She draws him. He finds peace. **A seven-year-old gave a 170-year-old ghost permission to rest.**
- **The Cats:** Clio's cat interactions are comic relief, but they also serve the plot. The cats know Galaxidi better than anyone. The orange cat on the bollard is sitting on something. Clio notices because she notices cats.

### Her Nintendo Brain

Clio's gaming background surfaces in how she approaches the adventure:
- She understands game logic naturally ("we need to find the key to open the thing")
- She references Mario mechanics: "Μπορεί να υπάρχει κρυφό block!" (There might be a hidden block!)
- She treats the token hunt like collecting stars
- She's the first to understand the game-within-the-game structure

### Music That Defines Her

If Clio had a soundtrack, it would be a simple melody on a glockenspiel — clear, bright, with moments of unexpected depth. She is the note that makes you cry because it's so pure.

## FAMILY DYNAMICS — THE THREE TOGETHER

### The Walking Order

When the family walks together, there's a natural formation:
- **Ntemis** leads, but not by much. He's half a step ahead, scanning for danger/interest.
- **Ajax** ranges wide — sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, always looking at something that isn't the path.
- **Clio** is between them, closer to whoever she's talking to. She holds Ntemis's hand through tricky terrain.

In the game, this translates to: Ntemis walks where the player clicks. Ajax and Clio follow with slight delays and offsets (already implemented as `familyFollow()`).

### Decision Making

- **Ntemis** decides the plan. "We'll visit the museum, then the port, then back for dinner."
- **Ajax** immediately suggests a better plan. "Or we could go to the port FIRST and—"
- **Clio** ignores both plans and finds something interesting on the way. "Μπαμπά, κοίτα αυτή τη γάτα!"
- The actual route is always Clio's accidental discovery.

### Conflict Patterns

- **Ntemis vs Ajax:** About risk. Ntemis says no, Ajax does it anyway, it either works out (and Ntemis secretly admires it) or doesn't (and Ntemis says "I told you" without conviction).
- **Ajax vs Clio:** Sibling teasing that's 100% love. Ajax calls her "μικρή" (little one) in a tone that means "my whole world." Clio retaliates by being funnier than him and knowing it.
- **Ntemis vs Clio:** There is no conflict. Clio owns her father completely. He knows it. She knows it. Ajax knows it. It's the family's open secret.

### What They Share

- **Seafood dinners** are the family ritual. In Galaxidi, this is amplified: fresh fish at a harbor taverna, Ajax ordering everything, Clio eating feta and kiwi somehow.
- **Storytelling before bed.** Ntemis tells stories about ancient Greece, modified for the audience. Ajax pretends he's too old for this. He's not.
- **The terrace.** The rented house's terrace is where the family is most itself. Morning espresso for Ntemis, juice for the kids, the Corinthian Gulf doing what it does.

### How They Solve Puzzles

Each character brings a different intelligence:

| Character | Puzzle Role | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Ntemis** | Reads, deduces, connects historical facts | Identifies which captain's ship matches the pact records |
| **Ajax** | Goes where others can't, tries physical solutions | Dives off the wall, climbs to the windmill, moves heavy stones |
| **Clio** | Notices what others miss, asks the right question | Spots the marking from the telescope, finds the loose tile, waves at the ghost |

The best puzzles in the game require all three: Ntemis reads the clue, Ajax accesses the location, Clio notices the detail that unlocks it.

## NPC RELATIONSHIP MAP

### How Each NPC Relates to Each Family Member

| NPC | → Ntemis | → Ajax | → Clio |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| **Akis** | Old friend, shared history | Watches him with avuncular warmth | Calls her "μικρή" with tenderness |
| **Stathis** | Old friend, shared music | The melody gives Ajax his first feeling of the past | Clio draws him playing |
| **Curator** | Intellectual equals | Tries to engage him (succeeds more than expected) | Lets her draw in the museum |
| **Athos** | Two lawyers recognizing each other | The "ατμόπλοιο" question aimed at him | Disarmed by her drawing of him |
| **Giannis** | Quiet respect between men of few words | Shows him the telescope | Smiles at her observation |
| **Papas** | Warm, philosophical | Tries to recruit him as altar boy | The candle scene — genuinely moved |
| **Chrysostomos** | Sailor-to-father connection | Takes him seriously as a young man | Clio falls asleep on the boat |
| **Ghost** | Recognizes a fellow father | Sees the future he died for | The wave. The peace. |

---

## BACKSTORY TIMELINE

### Before the Game Starts

| When | What |
|------|------|
| **Years ago** | Ntemis discovers Galaxidi. Falls in love with the town. Rents the stone house for holidays. |
| **Every summer** | Family visits. Ajax explores, Clio draws, Ntemis reads on the terrace. They know the basics — nice town, old harbor, good fish. |
| **This visit** | Something is different. A mysterious note in the kitchen. Dolphins in the harbor, circling like sentinels. The sense that Galaxidi has been waiting for them. |

### Why This Visit Is Different

The game never explicitly explains why NOW. But there are hints:
- The book left by the house owner was placed deliberately
- The note from "Γ." suggests someone knows they're coming
- The dolphins appeared the day they arrived
- The old photograph behind the bookshelf was never there before

The implication: **Galaxidi chose them.** The town has been waiting for a family that could hear its story — a father who reads, a boy who dares, and a girl who sees. The captains' treasure waited 170 years for the right finders. Not scholars. Not treasure hunters. A family. Because the pact was always about family.

## THE ANCESTORS

---

## ΚΑΠΕΤΑΝ ΛΟΥΚΑΣ ΒΙΣΒΙΚΗΣ / CAPTAIN LOUKAS VISVIKIS

**Lived:** ~1841–1903 | **Role:** The ghost, the letter writer, the reason for everything | **Ship:** Ελπίδα (Hope)

### Who He Was

Captain Loukas Visvikis — Ntemis's great-grandfather (προπάππος). The last great captain of Galaxidi. Not the richest, not the most famous, but the one who *understood*.

He commanded the schooner **Ελπίδα** — a ship he built with his own money, crewed with men from Galaxidi, and sailed across the Eastern Mediterranean: Smyrna, Alexandria, Beirut, Constantinople. The Ελπίδα was his pride, his livelihood, and his home for months at a time. He named her Hope because that's what she represented — not just for him, but for every family whose husband, father, or son sailed with her.

### The Captain's Character

Loukas was not a loud man. In a harbor full of boasting captains comparing tonnage and speed, Loukas was the one sitting on the bollard, pipe in hand, watching the horizon. He spoke when it mattered. His crew loved him not because he was generous (he was careful with money — a captain had to be) but because he was *fair*. Every man's share was exact. Every man's family was remembered when the Ελπίδα was at sea.

He had the Visvikis jaw — strong, slightly forward, the kind of face that looks like it was carved from Fokida limestone. Dark eyes that had seen every kind of weather. Hands that could tie any knot and read any chart but also write with the careful precision of a man who educated himself at sea, reading by oil lamp in his cabin while the watch changed above.

He was deeply religious — not in a showy way, but in the quiet way of a man who has been at sea in a storm and knows exactly how small he is. He paid for the roof of Agios Nikolaos church, for icons, even for the templon. Not for glory. Because the church was the last thing every captain saw leaving harbor and the first thing he saw coming home.

### The Pact Signer

Loukas was one of the signers of the αλληλασφάλεια — the mutual insurance pact that made Galaxidi unique. He believed in it absolutely. When his own ship was damaged in a storm off Crete in 1867, the pact rebuilt her in six weeks. Every captain contributed. No questions asked. That experience marked him forever: **community is not a luxury. It's the hull that keeps you afloat.**

He spoke about the pact the way some men speak about their wives — with quiet devotion and the certainty that without it, nothing else would work.

### The Voyage East and the Green Stone

Around 1880, Loukas made a voyage to the Levant that changed him. The details are unclear — family oral history blurs with legend. What's known:

- He sailed to Alexandria, then further east — possibly Beirut, possibly beyond
- He returned "changed" — quieter, more deliberate, carrying something
- He had acquired **something green** — a stone, an artifact, something he showed to no one
- From that voyage onward, he began hiding things around Galaxidi

What did he find? The game dramatizes this as a jade-like stone (πράσινη πέτρα), but the deeper truth is: **he found perspective**. He saw other ports, other systems, other ways of doing things. He saw the future coming — steam, iron, scale — and he understood what it meant for Galaxidi before anyone else did.

### The Vote — 9 to 3

The pivotal moment: at some point in the 1880s, a vote was held among Galaxidi's captains on whether to invest in a steamship. Loukas was one of the three who voted **yes**.

Nine captains voted no. The best sailors in Greece looked at the ugly, noisy, graceless steamship and said: *We are masters of the wind. We don't need this.* They were wrong. And they were wrong because they were so *good* at the old thing that they couldn't imagine needing the new thing.

Loukas knew. He'd seen the steamships in Alexandria harbor — faster, more reliable, carrying more cargo. He argued. He pleaded. He was outvoted.

This vote haunted him for the rest of his life. He carved a record of it in the cave at Plateia Mama: *"Πρόταση για επένδυση σε ατμόπλοιο. Απορρίφθηκε, 9 προς 3."* Not as accusation — as evidence. For whoever would come after and need to understand what happened.

### The Letter and the Treasure

In 1887, Loukas wrote the letter that drives the game's plot. He sealed it, hid it in his house (the same house the family rents generations later), and set in motion a treasure hunt designed not for profit but for *education*.

The "treasure" he hid was the original αλληλασφάλεια ledger — the real one, with 104 signatures. He kept it because he knew its value was not monetary but moral. He wanted it found by someone who would understand what it meant: **that Galaxidi's greatest achievement was not its ships but its solidarity, and its greatest failure was not poverty but inflexibility.**

His letter to the future:

> *«Φτιάξαμε κάτι σπουδαίο. Αλλά φοβηθήκαμε το καινούργιο. Αγαπήσαμε τον παλιό τρόπο τόσο πολύ που δεν μπορέσαμε να δούμε τον νέο. Μην κάνετε το ίδιο λάθος. Κρατήστε το σύμφωνο. Αλλάξτε το πλοίο.»*

He signed it Λ.Β. — his mark, found in the cave walls, in the church floor, in places around Galaxidi that only someone walking his footsteps would discover.

### His Death and Legacy

Loukas died in 1903 — the same year the *Χρυσούλα*, Galaxidi's last sailing ship, was launched. He lived long enough to see the harbor empty, the young men leave, the great fleet reduced to fishing boats. He watched Chios and Oinousses and Andros do what he had urged Galaxidi to do, and become the shipping dynasties of the new century.

He was buried in the old cemetery above town, with a marble headstone bearing a carved schooner — the Ελπίδα. His epitaph reads simply: **"Η θάλασσα θυμάται."** (The sea remembers.)

He died disappointed but not bitter. He had hidden his message. He trusted that someday, the right people would find it.

### The Ghost

In the graveyard scene, Loukas appears as a ghost. He is not frightening — he is tired and proud and a little sad. He has waited 120+ years for someone to come.

He doesn't speak. He gestures. He shows visions of what was and what was lost. He looks at Ajax and sees the future he fought for. He looks at Clio and sees innocence that deserves the truth. He looks at Ntemis and sees his own blood, carrying on.

When Clio waves, he waves back. When she draws him, she captures what no one else sees: "Κουρασμένος αλλά και χαρούμενος. Σαν κάποιος που τελικά μπορεί να κοιμηθεί." (Tired but also happy. Like someone who can finally sleep.)

He fades. At peace.

### The Ελπίδα Connection

The ship Ελπίδα survived Loukas. She was old when he died but sound — he built things to last. Over the generations, she passed through various hands in Galaxidi, always kept afloat, always repaired, never abandoned. By the time of the game, she belongs to **Chrysostomos** — old family friend, the last true sailor in Galaxidi.

Chrysostomos knows whose ship he sails. He maintains the Ελπίδα not just as a boat but as a memorial. When he takes the family on the crossing in Scene 8, he is carrying Loukas's great-grandchildren on Loukas's ship. He doesn't say this out loud. He doesn't need to.

The Ελπίδα's name — Hope — resonates through the entire game. Loukas named her for the future he believed in. The fact that she still sails, still carries people, still works, is proof that some things survive if you build them well and maintain them with love.

### His Marks Around Galaxidi

Loukas left his initials **Λ.Β.** (Loukas Visvikis) carved in specific places:

| Location | Mark | Significance |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Cave (Plateia Mama) | Λ.Β. 1887 + vote record | Where the captains met; where he recorded the vote |
| Agios Nikolaos Church | Λ.Β. on a floor tile | His benefaction; hides the nautical chart underneath |
| His gravestone | Carved Ελπίδα + epitaph | The final resting place; where the ghost appears |
| Harbor wall | Λ.Β. (visible only from windmill) | Spotted by Clio through the telescope |

### What He Means to Each Family Member

- **Ntemis:** The ancestor who validates his love of history and his instinct that the past has lessons. Finding Loukas's letter is like receiving a message from his own blood. The lawyer in him admires the precision of the treasure hunt. The philosopher in him is broken open by the letter's honesty.

- **Ajax:** At first, just a cool ancestor — a real captain! On a real ship! But as the game progresses, Ajax realizes Loukas was the one who SAW THE FUTURE and was ignored. The 9-to-3 vote becomes personal: Ajax imagines being one of the three, knowing you're right, and being outvoted anyway. **What do you do when you see the future and nobody listens?**

- **Clio:** She doesn't fully understand who Loukas was. But she feels him. She talks to his ghost naturally, like a child talks to a grandparent she never met. Her drawing of him is the game's most emotionally resonant image — a child's rendering of a man who waited 170 years for exactly this moment.

### Music That Defines Him

Solo Greek lyra. A melody that starts lonely and melancholy — the sound of an old man watching the harbor empty. Then it warms as the golden age is remembered. Then it quiets as the ships leave. Then it resolves into something peaceful as the ghost fades. **The sound of a man who loved a town, lost it, and finally let go.**

## THE NPCs

Each NPC represents a different facet of Galaxidi's relationship with its own past.

### ΕΠΙΜΕΛΗΤΗΣ / THE CURATOR — The Memory Keeper

**Age:** ~55 | **Scene:** Museum (Scene 4) | **Role:** The big history lesson, educator

#### Who He Is

Thin, reading glasses that are always slightly crooked, hands that gesture too much when he talks. The Curator runs the Nautical Museum of Galaxidi — small but dense with history. He is not from Galaxidi originally. He came thirty years ago to catalog the collection for "a few months" and never left. The town claimed him the way the sea claims driftwood: slowly, completely, permanently.

He knows every model ship by name, every captain's biography, every date. He can tell you the displacement tonnage of a polacca brigantine and the name of the cat that lived on the Χρυσούλα. He is the town's living archive, and he treats this responsibility with the seriousness of a priest guarding holy relics.

#### His Passion

The Curator's passion is not nostalgic — it's analytical. He loves the captains but he doesn't sentimentalize them. He's the one who walks visitors to the small, almost apologetic steamship model in the corner and says: "This ugly thing was the future. And they couldn't see it."

He has spent decades trying to understand WHY brilliant men made a terrible decision. His conclusion: excellence itself can be a trap. Being the best at sail made it psychologically impossible to embrace steam. **This insight IS the game's thesis, and the Curator delivers it.**

#### His Function in the Game

The museum scene is the game's educational heart. The Curator gives the full history:
- The golden age: ship types, trade routes, the pact
- The portraits: real names, real faces
- The decline: steam, refusal, the comparison with Chios/Oinousses/Andros

Ajax uses his phone in this scene — photographing inscriptions, Googling things (sometimes wrong, sometimes useful). The Curator engages him through the steamship conversation, leading to Ajax's key question about whether being the best can hurt you.

#### Voice

Fast, enthusiastic, slightly breathless. He interrupts himself with digressions. He answers questions with three other questions. He uses technical maritime terms and then apologizes. His glasses slide down his nose when he's excited, which is always.

- "Κοιτάξτε! Κοιτάξτε αυτό!" (Look! Look at this!) — his catchphrase
- "Περιμένετε, υπάρχει κι άλλο." (Wait, there's more.) — there's always more

#### Connection to the Family

With Ntemis, he's an intellectual equal — two enthusiasts geeking out. With Ajax, he makes a deliberate effort to engage, and succeeds more than expected (the steamship conversation). With Clio, he lets her draw in the museum, breaking every rule he normally enforces. He recognizes something in her attention that reminds him of why he stayed.

### ΑΘΟΣ / ATHOS — The Challenger

**Age:** 50 | **Scene:** Liotrivi (Scene 5) | **Role:** Gatekeeper, provocateur, the honest voice

#### Who He Is

Athos runs Liotrivi — the bar built inside an old olive press, stone walls, amber lighting, tsipouro on every table. He's also a lawyer. Brown hair, sharp features, reading glasses perched at his collar rather than on his nose. He has the look of a man who reads contracts for pleasure and cross-examines history the way he cross-examines witnesses.

He came to Galaxidi twenty years ago for a property case and never left. He bought Liotrivi because the building fascinated him — the old olive press, the stone, the layers of use. He runs the bar the way he runs his practice: precisely, with warmth that only surfaces once you've earned it.

He has read Visvikis's will. Not because anyone asked him to — because he found it in the municipal archives while researching another case. Professional deformity, he calls it. The will left everything "to Galaxidi" — not to a person, to the town. That detail has haunted him ever since.

#### His Function in the Game

Athos is the challenger. Where the Curator explains and Akis remembers, Athos *pushes*. He confirms the cave location, reveals the will's contents, and then delivers the line that stays with Ajax for the rest of the game:

"Ποιο είναι το ατμόπλοιο σήμερα; Ποιο είναι αυτό που έρχεται, και πρέπει να το πιάσουμε αυτή τη φορά;"

He doesn't have the answer. He says so openly. But he's asking the right question.

He also says what nobody else will: the captains were **great AND stubborn**. Both. The two go together more often than you'd think. This is the uncomfortable truth, delivered with lawyerly precision and a glass of tsipouro.

#### Voice

Sharp, precise, dry humor with warmth underneath. He speaks in complete sentences that sound like closing arguments. He listens more than he talks, but when he talks, every word is chosen.

- "Μη με ρωτήσεις αν αξίζεις. Πήγαινε και δείξ' το." (Don't ask me if you're worthy. Go prove it.)
- "Τα δύο πάνε μαζί πιο συχνά απ' ό,τι νομίζεις." (The two go together more often than you'd think.)
- "Χειρότερα. Δικηγόρος." (Worse. Lawyer.) — when Clio says he looks like a judge

#### Connection to the Family

With Ntemis: two lawyers recognizing each other — the way they build arguments, the way they read documents, the respect for precision. Athos sees a kindred spirit and offers his hardest challenge as a form of respect.

With Ajax: the "ατμόπλοιο σήμερα" question is aimed at him specifically. Athos recognizes that the next generation is where the answer lives.

With Clio: amused, disarmed. When she draws him as a judge, his laugh is real — the first unguarded moment we see from him.

---

### ΠΑΠΑΣ / PAPAS — The Keeper of Faith

**Age:** ~65 | **Scene:** Agios Nikolaos Church (Scene 9) | **Role:** Faith-maritime connection, emotional depth

#### Who He Is

The priest of Agios Nikolaos — Galaxidi's patron saint church overlooking the harbor. He's warm, slightly mischievous, proud of his church's layers: the current building, the older one beneath, foundations older still.

He's not a typical stern village priest. He has a twinkle. He tells jokes during the liturgy (quietly, to the altar boys). He keeps a chess set in the vestry. He knows every fisherman's confession and none of their secrets leave the stone walls.

He knows the church's relationship with the captains intimately: every voyage began with a prayer here, every safe return ended with a thanksgiving candle. Agios Nikolaos isn't just a patron saint — he's the witness to every departure and every homecoming. The captains' faith was practical: pray, sail, insure each other, pray again.

#### His Secret Knowledge

The Papas knows Loukas Visvikis was the church's biggest benefactor — the roof, the icons, the templon. He also knows (or suspects) that Loukas hid something in the church. He's never looked. That's not his business. His business is keeping the church alive, and the church has been alive for centuries because people like Loukas loved it enough to maintain it.

When Ntemis asks about Visvikis, the Papas gives information willingly — but only after Clio lights a candle for the captains. That act of simple faith earns more than any question could.

#### Voice

Warm, resonant, with an unexpected humor. He calls everyone "παιδί μου" (my child) regardless of age. He quotes scripture and seamanship in the same breath, and doesn't see a contradiction.

- "Παιδί μου, ο Θεός και η θάλασσα έχουν πολλά κοινά. Κανένα δεν σε ρωτάει αν είσαι έτοιμος." (My child, God and the sea have much in common. Neither asks if you're ready.)
- "ΟΧΙ στις εικόνες!" — when Ajax tries to climb

#### The Candle Scene

The game's quietest emotional moment. Clio lights a candle. The Papas asks who it's for.

CLIO: Για τους καπεταναίους. Και τα πλοία τους.
PAPAS *(moved)*: Αυτό, παιδί μου, είναι ακριβώς αυτό που έκαναν κι εκείνοι.

He's moved because a seven-year-old just instinctively did what the captains did for centuries. The chain is unbroken. This is why the Papas shares his extra clue — not because they earned it through cleverness, but because Clio proved the spirit is still alive.

### ΧΡΥΣΟΣΤΟΜΟΣ / CHRYSOSTOMOS — The Last Sailor

**Age:** ~70 | **Scene:** Boat / The Crossing (Scene 10) | **Role:** Wisdom, acceptance, the most beautiful scene

#### Who He Is

Old family friend. The last true sailor in Galaxidi — not a fisherman catching mullet, but a man who understands the gulf the way the old captains understood the Mediterranean. His seamanship is effortless, the kind that comes from fifty years of reading water and wind.

He sails the **Ελπίδα** — Loukas Visvikis's ship, passed down through generations, maintained with devotion. Chrysostomos knows whose ship he sails. He doesn't advertise it. The Ελπίδα is his responsibility, not his trophy.

He's the bridge between the old way and acceptance. Where Stavros is bitter and the Curator is analytical, Chrysostomos is at peace. He loved the old way. He lost it. He made peace with the loss. And his peace is the permission Ntemis needs to stop clinging to his own past.

#### His Wisdom

Chrysostomos's signature speech:

"Ξέρεις, εγώ δεν κατηγορώ τους παλιούς καπεταναίους. Ήξεραν τον άνεμο σαν τη γυναίκα τους. Πώς να τους πεις να πετάξουν αυτό; Αλλά η θάλασσα δεν σε ρωτάει τι αγαπάς. Η θάλασσα αλλάζει κι εσύ αλλάζεις μαζί της, αλλιώς πνίγεσαι."

*"I don't blame the old captains. They knew the wind like their own wife. How do you tell a man to throw that away? But the sea doesn't ask what you love. The sea changes and you change with it, or you drown."*

This is the game's most mature expression of its thesis. Not analysis (Curator), not challenge (Athos), not faith (Papas) — just quiet acceptance that change is the sea's nature, and fighting it is like fighting the tide.

#### The Crossing

The boat scene (Scene 10) is the game's most beautiful sequence. Chrysostomos takes the family across the gulf to Agios Georgios. Galaxidi seen from the water. Mountains. Dawn.

He tells stories the whole way — what it was like to sail these waters, the routes, the weather patterns, the dangers. But the stories aren't boasting. They're offerings. He's giving the family his life's knowledge because he senses they'll need it — not for sailing, but for understanding.

On the return, Clio falls asleep on Ntemis's lap. Ajax watches Galaxidi grow closer from the bow. Chrysostomos hums the ghost's theme without knowing why.

#### Voice

Slow, steady, rhythmic — like waves. He doesn't waste words. When he speaks, the sea sounds louder because he's quiet. His humor is dry and kind.

- "Η Ελπίδα ξέρει τον δρόμο. Εγώ απλά κρατάω το τιμόνι." (Hope knows the way. I just hold the tiller.)
- "Θα φτάσουμε. Πάντα φτάνουμε." (We'll get there. We always do.)

#### Real-World Thread

In real Galaxidi, Ajax's friend Dimitris has a brother named Chrysostomos (parents: Vassilis and Evangelia). The NPC carries echoes of this real connection — the game's Chrysostomos is the old sailor the real Chrysostomos might become in sixty years, still on the water, still knowing the gulf's moods.

### THE NPC ORCHESTRA

Together, the NPCs form a progression — an eight-part response to the same question: *What do you do with a glorious past?*

| NPC | Response to the Past | Emotional Key |
|-----|---------------------|---------------|
| **Akis** | Remember it warmly | Nostalgia as connection |
| **Stathis** | Sing about it | Art as preservation |
| **Curator** | Study it | Understanding as devotion |
| **Athos** | Challenge it | Honesty as respect |
| **Giannis** | Watch over it | Silence as guardianship |
| **Papas** | Bless it | Faith as continuity |
| **Chrysostomos** | Accept it | Peace as wisdom |
| **Ghost (Loukas)** | Release it | Rest as resolution |

The player encounters them in this order, and each one adds a layer until the full picture emerges: the past is worth remembering, worth singing about, worth studying, worth challenging, worth watching over, worth blessing, worth accepting, and finally — worth releasing. **That's the emotional arc of the game, delivered through eight voices.**
