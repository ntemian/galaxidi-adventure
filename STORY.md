# Το Μυστήριο του Γαλαξειδίου — Story Bible

## Logline

A father and his two children arrive in Galaxidi to settle their great-grandfather's house — and discover a 120-year-old treasure hunt left by Captain Visvikis, the last captain who believed Galaxidi could be great again.

## Theme

**"Κράτα την αλληλεγγύη. Άλλαξε το πλοίο."** — Two lessons woven into one story: (1) The power of solidarity — the captains who protected each other through αλληλασφάλεια. (2) The danger of not adapting — the captains who mastered sail but refused steam. The treasure isn't gold — it's understanding that you must hold onto what binds you together while having the courage to change.

## Setting

**Galaxidi (Γαλαξίδι)**, Corinthian Gulf, Greece. Late September 2026. End of summer — golden light, warm stone, the sea impossibly blue. A town that was once the greatest shipbuilding port in Greece (300 ships, 6,000 residents at its peak in 1870), now a quiet fishing village that holds its secrets close.

## Characters

### Ntemis (Ντέμης) — The Father
- 47, calm, warm, thoughtful. Lawyer by profession, philosopher by nature. Sees beauty in small things.
- Great-grandson of Captain Loukas Visvikis. Knows Galaxidi from childhood summers.
- Returns to settle the great-grandfather's house (inheritance). Doesn't expect an adventure.
- Reads inscriptions, identifies documents, connects historical dots. The party's librarian.
- "Ας δούμε..." — his thinking-out-loud start.

### Ajax (Αίαντας) — The Son
- 13, energetic, curious, brave. Basketball player, swimmer, climber.
- Asks questions about everything. First to volunteer for adventure. Acts before thinking.
- "Μπαμπά, πάμε!" is his catchphrase. Also: "Σοβαρά τώρα;" (Seriously?)
- Can reach small spaces, climbs where others can't, digs when needed.
- Uses his phone constantly — sometimes hilariously wrong, sometimes genuinely useful.
- Blurts out accidental wisdom he doesn't realize is profound.

### Clio (Κλειώ) — The Daughter
- 7, observant, creative, wise beyond her years. Named after the Muse of History.
- Notices details others miss — looks where no one else does. The emotional heart of the story.
- Draws people and moments in her notebook. Her drawings contain clues.
- "Κοιτάξτε..." is her catchphrase — she's always pointing out what matters.
- A cat follows her throughout the entire game.
- Speaks in images, thinks in colors. Her questions are devastating because they're simple.

### The NPC Orchestra

Each NPC represents a different response to the question: *What do you do with a glorious past?*

| NPC | Response | Emotional Key |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| **Akis** | Remember it warmly | Nostalgia as connection |
| **Stathis** | Sing about it | Art as preservation |
| **Curator** | Study it | Understanding as devotion |
| **Athos** | Challenge it | Honesty as respect |
| **Giannis** | Watch over it | Silence as guardianship |
| **Papas** | Bless it | Faith as continuity |
| **Chrysostomos** | Accept it | Peace as wisdom |
| **Ghost** | Release it | Rest as resolution |

The player encounters them in this order, and each one adds a layer until the full picture emerges.

## The Quest

Captain Loukas Visvikis (1841–1903), the last great captain of Galaxidi, traveled to the East and returned with a jade stone and a fortune. He hid his treasure for someone who would love Galaxidi enough to find it. He left a letter in his house with instructions. The family must follow the trail: house → harbor (friends) → museum → liotrivi → windmill → cave → graveyard → church → boat → island → treasure → and then do what Visvikis dreamed: use it to make Galaxidi great again.

### Key Items
- **Visvikis's Letter** (Scene 2) — The quest hook. "Find the green stone."
- **Captain's Photograph** (Scene 2) — From the house, shows Visvikis in captain's dress.
- **The Green Stone / Jade** (Scene 7) — Found in Karkaros cave where "the earth speaks." Warm to the touch.
- **Brass Lantern / Φανάρι** (Scene 6) — Given by Giannis at the windmill. Used in the cave.
- **Nautical Chart** (Scene 9) — Hidden under a floor tile in Agios Nikolaos church. Marks Agios Georgios island.
- **The Treasure Chest** (Scene 11) — On Agios Georgios island. Contains gold coins, jade necklace, the original αλληλασφάλεια ledger, and Visvikis's final letter.

### Captain Loukas Visvikis (1841–1903)

The last great captain. Commanded the schooner **Ελπίδα** (Hope). Sailed to Smyrna, Alexandria, Beirut. Around 1880, a voyage east changed him — he returned carrying something green and a new perspective. He had seen steamships in Alexandria harbor and understood what they meant for Galaxidi.

He was one of the signers of the **αλληλασφάλεια** — the mutual insurance pact of 1860. When his own ship was damaged off Crete in 1867, the pact rebuilt her in six weeks. That experience marked him forever: community is not a luxury, it's the hull that keeps you afloat.

**The Vote — 9 to 3**: A vote was held among Galaxidi's captains on whether to invest in a steamship. Loukas was one of three who voted **yes**. Nine voted no. The best sailors in Greece couldn't imagine needing something new. Loukas carved a record of this vote in the Karkaros cave: *"Πρόταση για ατμόπλοιο. Απορρίφθηκε, 9 προς 3."*

He died in 1903 — the same year the Χρυσούλα, Galaxidi's last sailing ship, was launched. He watched the harbor empty and the young leave. He was buried with a carved schooner on his headstone and the epitaph: **"Η θάλασσα θυμάται."**

His marks **Λ.Β.** are found: in the cave (1887 + vote record), on a floor tile in Agios Nikolaos church, and on his gravestone. A trail for whoever walks his footsteps.

## Scene Structure (12 Scenes + Epilogue)

### SCENE 1 — ΑΦΙΞΗ (Arrival)

*The family arrives at Galaxidi by car. Late afternoon, golden hour.*

**Story beats**:
1. Family walks through the crescent harbor. An old woman in black nods. A cat follows Clio.
2. Ntemis: "Φτάσαμε. Πρέπει να βρούμε το σπίτι του παππού."
3. Ajax: "Ποιου παππού;" — Ntemis: "Του προπάππου μου. Κανένας δεν έχει μπει εδώ χρόνια. Κληρονομιά."
4. Clio: "Θα έχει φαντάσματα;" — Ntemis: "...Όχι, Κλειώ. Θα έχει σκόνη."
5. They find the house on a narrow lane. Old stone, blue door, bougainvillea. The key barely turns.
6. The door opens. Dust and memory pour out.

**Gameplay**: Tutorial — learn to click, walk, look. Explore harbor (bollards, boats, cat). Walk to house → exit to Scene 2.

**Music**: Warm acoustic guitar. The main theme, simple and solo. Cicadas. Mediterranean afternoon.

---

### SCENE 2 — ΤΟ ΣΠΙΤΙ ΤΟΥ ΠΑΠΠΟΥ (The Grandfather's House)

*Dark interior. Ntemis opens shutters one by one. Golden light floods in to reveal a captain's house frozen in 1903.*

**Story beats**:
1. Model ships on shelves, brass instruments, charts on walls. A faded photograph of Captain Visvikis.
2. Clio: "Ποιος είναι αυτός;" — Ntemis: "Ο Καπετάν Βισβίκης. Ο προπάππους μου."
3. Ajax finds a locked desk drawer. Clio finds the key in a copper pot on the mantle.
4. Inside the drawer: **Visvikis's letter** (1887). Sealed with wax. Instructions to find "the green stone" hidden "where the earth speaks — where rocks become cave and sound never leaves."
5. Ajax: "'Φέρε τη σε μένα'... Είναι νεκρός εδώ και εκατό χρόνια." Clio: "Στο νεκροταφείο, βλάκα." Ntemis: "...Κλειώ." Clio: "Τι; Λογικό είναι."

**Inventory**: + Γράμμα Βισβίκη, + Φωτογραφία Καπετάνιου

**Gameplay**: Open shutters (light reveals room). Examine photo, ships, instruments. Find locked drawer → key in pot → letter. Quest begins.

**Music**: Crossfade from acoustic guitar to mysterious piano. Swells when letter is read — adventure theme enters for the first time.

---

### SCENE 3 — Η ΠΑΡΕΑ (The Friends on the Harbor)

*The harbor at golden hour. The anchor monument. A blue bench overlooking the quay. Akis and Stathis sit playing music — φλογέρα and guitar. Taverna lights coming on behind them.*

**Story beats**:
1. Ntemis spots two old friends on the waterfront. Recognition. Warm reunion — hugs, laughter, years compressed into smiles. Ajax and Clio hang back, watching.
2. Akis (φλογέρα) and Stathis (guitar) play a slow sailors' melody. The harbor listens. A fisherman stops pulling nets to listen.
3. Ntemis: "Πόσα χρόνια, ρε παιδιά;" Akis: "Αρκετά. Αλλά το Γαλαξίδι δε σ' αφήνει να ξεχάσεις."
4. Clio asks about the melody — "Λυπημένο αλλά ωραίο." Stathis: "Ήταν το τραγούδι των ναυτικών. Το τραγουδούσαν όταν έφευγαν."
5. Ntemis shows the letter. Akis goes quiet. He knows the name Visvikis well — everyone in Galaxidi does, but Akis has read the old records.
6. Akis: "Ταξίδεψε στη Σμύρνη, στην Αλεξάνδρεια, στη Βηρυτό. Λέγανε ότι γύρισε με κάτι πράσινο... κάτι που δεν έδειξε σε κανέναν."
7. On the clue "where the earth speaks": Akis: "Ο Κάρκαρος. Το σπήλαιο πίσω από την πλατεία Μάμα. Μπαίνεις μέσα και η φωνή σου γυρίζει πίσω τρεις φορές."
8. Akis points to the museum: "Αν θέλεις να καταλάβεις τον Βισβίκη, πρέπει να δεις πρώτα τι έχασε το Γαλαξίδι. Εκεί ζει η ιστορία."
9. Stathis: "Και μίλα στον Άθο στο Λιοτρίβι. Ξέρει κάθε οικογένεια, κάθε μυστικό. Διάβασε και τη διαθήκη."
10. Clio draws the two musicians on the bench. "Σαν να παίζουν για τη θάλασσα." Akis: "Γιατί αυτό κάνουμε, μικρή."

**Gameplay**: Approach bench → reunion sequence. Talk to Akis (Visvikis legend + museum hint). Talk to Stathis (Liotrivi/Athos hint). Show letter to other harbor NPCs for comic responses (old woman crosses herself, taverna owner laughs: "Βισβίκης! Ο τρελός καπετάνιος!"). Listen to sailors' melody (returns in epilogue). Clio notebook moment. Exit to Museum or Liotrivi.

**Music**: Live φλογέρα + guitar, a Mediterranean sailors' melody. Warm, nostalgic, bittersweet. This melody becomes a motif — it returns in the epilogue.

---

### SCENE 4 — ΤΟ ΝΑΥΤΙΚΟ ΜΟΥΣΕΙΟ (The Maritime Museum)

*Warm wood, naval flags, model ships in glass cases. Captain portraits — proud men with beards and dress coats.*

**Story beats**:
1. The Curator lights up at the name Visvikis. Leads them to his portrait — the same face as the house photograph, but younger.
2. The golden age: "Τριακόσια καράβια. Έξι χιλιάδες κάτοικοι. Το Γαλαξίδι ήταν η ναυτική πρωτεύουσα της Ελλάδας."
3. Ajax photographs inscriptions with his phone. Googles "Galaxidi ships" — gets autocorrected to "Galaxy ships." Ntemis: "Βάλ' το κάτω."
4. The steamship corner — a small, iron, ugly model next to the graceful schooners: "...ήρθε ο ατμός. Κι αυτοί που ήξεραν τα πάντα για τα πανιά, αρνήθηκαν να μάθουν κάτι καινούριο."
5. Ajax's key question: "Δηλαδή... ήταν οι καλύτεροι, κι αυτό τους έκανε χειρότερους;" Curator: "Ακριβώς, μικρέ μου. Ακριβώς αυτό."
6. Clio finds the αλληλασφάλεια display — a copy of the 1860 mutual insurance ledger. 104 captains signed.
7. Ajax: "Εκατόν τέσσερις υπογραφές. Σαν ομάδα." Curator smiles: "Η πιο σημαντική ομάδα που είχε ποτέ αυτή η πόλη."

**Gameplay**: Explore museum — model ships, portraits, instruments. Curator dialog tree. Steamship corner — pivotal narrative turn. Ajax uses phone (comic + useful moment). Clio finds αλληλασφάλεια display. Exit to Liotrivi.

**Music**: Reflective piano and strings. Grand for golden age. Minor key at steamship corner — the sound of something ending.

---

### SCENE 5 — ΛΙΟΤΡΙΒΙ (The Old Olive Press)

*Evening. Stone walls, amber lanterns, the old olive press preserved as decor. Athos behind the bar — 50, brown hair, sharp features, reading glasses perched at his collar.*

**Story beats**:
1. Ntemis asks about Visvikis. Athos sets down his glass. His lawyer's eyes sharpen.
2. Athos: "Ξέρεις ότι διάβασα τη διαθήκη του; Επαγγελματική διαστροφή — ψάχνω παλιά έγγραφα. Τα άφησε όλα 'στο Γαλαξίδι.' Όχι σε πρόσωπο. Στην πόλη."
3. Ajax blurts: "Εμείς ξέρουμε! 'Εκεί που η γη μιλάει.'" Athos nods: the Karkaros cave behind Plateia Mama.
4. He pours tsipouro for Ntemis, lemonade for the kids. Leans in: "Μη με ρωτήσεις αν αξίζεις. Πήγαινε και δείξ' το."
5. Ajax: "Αλλά στο μουσείο είπαν ότι οι καπεταναίοι ήταν σπουδαίοι ΚΑΙ πεισματάρηδες." Athos: "Ήταν. Τα δύο πάνε μαζί πιο συχνά απ' ό,τι νομίζεις."
6. Athos, quiet now: "Ποιο είναι το ατμόπλοιο σήμερα; Ποιο είναι αυτό που έρχεται, και πρέπει να το πιάσουμε αυτή τη φορά;" The question hangs in the air. No one answers. Ajax remembers it for the rest of the game.
7. Clio draws Athos in her notebook: "Μοιάζεις με δικαστή." Athos: "Χειρότερα. Δικηγόρος."

**Gameplay**: Talk to Athos — confirms cave, reveals will details, delivers the challenge. Examine olive press, bottles, photos on walls. Clio draws Athos (notebook moment). Exit to Windmill or Plateia Mama → Cave.

**Music**: Rebetiko warmth. Bouzouki and guitar, amber and smoky. Quieter when Athos speaks about Visvikis's will. Silence on the "ατμόπλοιο σήμερα" line.

---

### SCENE 6 — Ο ΜΥΛΟΣ (The Windmill)

*Old stone windmill on the hill above town. Panoramic view of the gulf, the harbor, the mountains. Wildflowers between cracked stones. Wind hums through the ruins.*

**Story beats**:
1. The family climbs the path. Giannis stands at the windmill door, watching the gulf below.
2. Giannis: "Ξέρεις γιατί αγόρασα τον μύλο; Γιατί από εδώ βλέπεις τα πάντα."
3. He shows them the view — the harbor, the cave entrance below, the church, the islands. The whole quest laid out from above.
4. Giannis points out the cave entrance from this vantage point: "Εκεί κάτω. Πίσω από την πλατεία Μάμα. Θα χρειαστείτε φως."
5. He gives them a brass lantern — old, well-kept, nautical. "Ήταν του πατέρα μου. Ναυτικός. Πάρ' το."
6. Ajax looks through telescope: "Βλέπω το νησάκι! Εκεί θα πάμε;" Ntemis: "Αν βρούμε αυτό που ψάχνουμε στο σπήλαιο."
7. Clio: "Σαν τον Βισβίκη. Αυτός ήθελε να μείνει κάτι." Giannis smiles but says nothing.

**Inventory**: + Φανάρι (lantern)

**Gameplay**: Climb path to windmill. Talk to Giannis — panoramic view reveals quest geography. Receive lantern. Look through telescope (optional — see island detail, Ajax spots something). Exit down to Plateia Mama → Cave.

**Music**: Wind and open air. Sparse acoustic guitar, birdsong, distant town sounds below. Panoramic calm — the moment before descent.

---

### SCENE 7 — ΤΟ ΣΠΗΛΑΙΟ (The Cave of Karkaros)

*Plateia Mama. Behind old crates and overgrown bushes: the cave entrance. Inside: dripping water, echo, darkness.*

**Story beats**:
1. Ntemis lights the lantern. Walls covered in old marks — ship names, initials, dates scratched into stone over centuries.
2. Ajax: "Μπαμπά, κοίτα — ο Βισβίκης ήταν εδώ. 'Λ.Β. 1887.'"
3. Ajax spots something higher up — scratched into the rock above head height. He climbs. Reads aloud: **"Πρόταση για ατμόπλοιο. Απορρίφθηκε, 9 προς 3."** Silence.
4. Ntemis translates for both kids: a vote. Someone wanted to buy a steamship. Nine captains said no. Three said yes. Visvikis was one of the three.
5. Ajax, quiet now: "Τρεις ήξεραν. Και κανείς δεν τους άκουσε." He's thinking of Athos's question. *What's the steamship of today?*
6. They search for the jade. Ntemis at ground level. Ajax checks crevices at his height. Nothing.
7. Clio looks UP — the angle only a seven-year-old would try. She sees it. Wedged into a crack above eye level: **THE GREEN STONE.** Smooth, dark green jade, roughly fist-sized. Warm to the touch.
8. Ntemis: "Νεφρίτης. Jade. Από την Ανατολή, σίγουρα." Ajax: "Αξίζει κάτι;" Ntemis: "Αξίζει ό,τι ο Βισβίκης ήθελε να δείξει μ' αυτό. Τώρα πρέπει... να του το πάμε."
9. Clio: "Σας το είπα." Ajax: "...Στο νεκροταφείο." Clio: "Σας. Το. Είπα."

**Inventory**: + Πράσινη Πέτρα (Jade)

**Gameplay**: Enter cave with lantern (light → dark transition). Examine wall markings, find "Λ.Β. 1887." Ajax climbs to discover vote inscription — his big moment. Search wrong spots first. Clio finds stone (she looks up). Green stone goes to inventory.

**Music**: Underground wonder. Echoing, dripping, mysterious but warm — not scary. Silence when vote inscription is read. Resonant crystalline tone when stone is found. The jade has its own sound.

---

### SCENE 8 — ΤΟ ΝΕΚΡΟΤΑΦΕΙΟ (The Captain's Rest)

*Dusk. The old cemetery above town. Marble headstones with carved ships. Cypress trees. Wild thyme. The sea visible beyond.*

**Story beats**:
1. Every headstone is a biography — ships carved in marble. Clio reads names aloud. Ajax photographs them.
2. They find Visvikis's grave: marble captain's headstone, carved schooner (the Ελπίδα), 1841–1903. Epitaph: **"Η θάλασσα θυμάται."**
3. Ntemis places the green stone on the headstone. Silence.
4. The air changes. Not cold — different. Clio grabs Ntemis's hand. Ajax steps back. He reaches for his phone, then puts it away.
5. **The ghost of Captain Visvikis appears.** Not frightening — weathered, proud, tired. Captain's coat, white beard. He smiles: the smile of a man who has waited 120 years.
6. He doesn't speak. He looks at each of them: at Ntemis (his blood, carrying on), at Ajax (the future he fought for), at Clio (innocence that deserves the truth).
7. He points down the hill, toward the harbor, toward **Agios Nikolaos church**. Traces a cross in the air — but also a compass rose.
8. Clio whispers: "Ο χάρτης. Θέλει να βρούμε τον χάρτη. Είναι στον Άγιο Νικόλαο." The ghost nods.
9. Clio waves at the ghost. The ghost waves back. Then fades. The green stone glows once, then goes dark.
10. Ajax: "...Μόλις μας έδωσε οδηγίες ένα φάντασμα." Ntemis: "Μόλις μας έδωσε οδηγίες ο προπάππους μου."
11. Clio draws the ghost in her notebook: "Κουρασμένος αλλά χαρούμενος. Σαν κάποιος που τελικά μπορεί να κοιμηθεί."

**Gameplay**: Explore graveyard — read 3-4 captain headstones (micro-biographies). Find Visvikis's grave. Use green stone on headstone → ghost sequence. Ghost looks at each family member. Points to church → Clio waves → ghost fades. Clio interprets.

**Music**: THE GHOST'S THEME. Solo Greek lyra. Lonely and melancholy → warms as the ghost smiles → quiet as he fades → resolves into peace.

---

### SCENE 9 — ΑΓΙΟΣ ΝΙΚΟΛΑΟΣ (The Map in the Church)

*Church interior at candlelight. Icons gleaming gold. The famous wooden iconostasis. Silence and beeswax.*

**Story beats**:
1. Ntemis: "Πάτερ, ψάχνουμε κάτι που άφησε ο Καπετάν Βισβίκης." Papas: Visvikis was the church's greatest benefactor — paid for the roof, the icons, the iconostasis. Every voyage began with a prayer here, every safe return ended with a thanksgiving candle.
2. Clio lights a candle. Papas: "Για ποιον;" Clio: "Για τους καπεταναίους. Και τα πλοία τους." Papas, moved: "Αυτό, παιδί μου, είναι ακριβώς αυτό που έκαναν κι εκείνοι."
3. They search. Ntemis examines icons. Ajax tries to climb the iconostasis. Papas: "ΟΧΙ στις εικόνες!"
4. Everyone looks up, looks around. Clio sits quietly, looking at the floor.
5. Clio: "Μπαμπά. Το πάτωμα." A floor tile near the altar has Visvikis's mark — the same "Λ.Β." from the cave. It's loose.
6. Underneath: **a rolled nautical chart**, sealed in oilcloth. Protected for over a century. Hand-drawn. The Corinthian Gulf, Galaxidi, and marked with an X: the tiny island of **Άγιος Γεώργιος**.
7. Margin note in Visvikis's hand: "Το βράχι κοιτάει νοτιοδυτικά. Κάτω από τον σταυρό, πέντε βήματα. Σκάψε."
8. Ajax: "Ξέρω αυτό το νησάκι! Μπορούμε να πάμε με βάρκα!" Papas: "Αν βρείτε κάτι... θυμηθείτε ποιος το σώζει. Αυτή η πόλη χρειάζεται θαύματα."

**Inventory**: + Ναυτικός Χάρτης

**Gameplay**: Talk to Papas. Clio lights candle (emotional beat). Examine icons, iconostasis (wrong spots). Ajax climbing (comic beat). Clio spots floor tile with "Λ.Β." Open tile → chart. Map to inventory → exit to harbor/boat.

**Music**: Sacred warmth. Deep choral tones with warm reverb. Swells when map discovered — adventure theme returns, now richer.

---

### SCENE 10 — ΤΟ ΚΑΡΑΒΙ (The Crossing)

*Dawn. The boat Ελπίδα on the gulf. Galaxidi receding behind them. Agios Georgios ahead.*

**Story beats**:
1. Chrysostomos stands by his boat — the **Ελπίδα**, Visvikis's own ship, passed down through generations, maintained with devotion. He knows whose ship he sails. He doesn't advertise it.
2. Chrysostomos: "Ο πατέρας σου μου είπε ότι κάποια μέρα θα ερχόσουν. Δεν πίστευα ότι θα ζούσα να το δω."
3. The crossing is short but magical. Galaxidi seen from the water — the town in its landscape, mountains behind, the gulf stretching.
4. Chrysostomos tells Visvikis's story: "Ήταν ο τελευταίος ρομαντικός. Ταξίδεψε μέχρι την Ανατολή κι επέστρεψε. Έλεγε ότι βρήκε κάτι που θα σώσει το Γαλαξίδι. Κανείς δεν τον πίστεψε. Πέθανε μόνος. Αλλά δεν πέθανε χωρίς σχέδιο."
5. His deepest wisdom, delivered to the water more than to anyone: "Εγώ δεν κατηγορώ τους παλιούς καπεταναίους. Ήξεραν τον άνεμο σαν τη γυναίκα τους. Αλλά η θάλασσα δεν σε ρωτάει τι αγαπάς. Η θάλασσα αλλάζει κι εσύ αλλάζεις μαζί της, αλλιώς πνίγεσαι."
6. They land on the rocky islet. A tiny chapel of Agios Georgios. Wild thyme and oregano. Seagulls wheeling.
7. The rock that faces southwest. The old stone cross. Five steps.
8. Ajax digs. Clio counts the steps. Ntemis watches. The shovel hits wood.

**Gameplay**: Board boat (scenic transition). Click landmarks during crossing for Chrysostomos's stories. Arrive at island. Find southwest rock → cross → count 5 steps. Ajax digs → transition to treasure.

**Music**: THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MUSIC IN THE GAME. Acoustic guitar and lyra. Dawn on the water. A melody that aches with hope. The Ελπίδα's name is the sound.

---

### SCENE 11 — Ο ΘΗΣΑΥΡΟΣ (The Treasure)

*Close-up: an old sea chest, iron-bound, emerging from the earth. Morning light. Galaxidi across the water.*

**Story beats**:
1. A sea chest. Old, iron-bound. Visvikis built things to last. They open it.
2. Inside: **Gold coins** (Ottoman, Venetian, ancient Greek). **A jade necklace** matching the green stone. **The original αλληλασφάλεια ledger** — the mutual insurance pact of 1860 with 104 captain signatures. The real one. And **a letter**:

> *Αυτός ο θησαυρός δεν είναι δικός μου. Είναι του Γαλαξειδίου.*
>
> *Ταξίδεψα στην Ανατολή και γύρισα πλούσιος. Αλλά ο αληθινός πλούτος δεν είναι ο χρυσός. Είναι αυτό που χτίσαμε μαζί — η αλληλεγγύη. Κανείς δεν ταξιδεύει μόνος.*
>
> *Το Γαλαξίδι σβήνει. Τα καράβια φεύγουν. Ο κόσμος αλλάζει κι εμείς δεν αλλάζουμε μαζί του. Αλλά αυτός ο θησαυρός μπορεί να ξαναχτίσει αυτό που χάσαμε — αν αυτός που τον βρει αγαπάει αυτή την πόλη αρκετά.*
>
> ***Κράτα την αλληλεγγύη. Άλλαξε το πλοίο.***
>
> *— Καπ. Λ. Βισβίκης*

3. Silence. Waves and gulls.
4. Clio: "Μπαμπά, τι θα κάνουμε;" Ntemis: "Αυτό που ήθελε ο Βισβίκης. Θα τα δώσουμε στο Γαλαξίδι."
5. Ajax reads the old signatures: "Εκατό τέσσερις. Εκατό τέσσερις άνθρωποι υπέγραψαν. Κανένας δεν ταξιδεύει μόνος."
6. Clio: "Αν ο Βισβίκης μπορούσε να δει τώρα, θα χαμογελούσε;" Ntemis: "Ναι, μικρή μου. Νομίζω ότι τώρα, μπορεί επιτέλους να κοιμηθεί."

**The return**: Chrysostomos takes them back. Sunset. Clio falls asleep on Ntemis's lap, the jade necklace in her hand. Ajax watches Galaxidi grow closer from the bow, quiet and thoughtful. Chrysostomos hums a melody — the ghost's theme — without knowing why he knows it.

**Music**: Building from silence. Each item revealed adds an instrument — coins (percussion), necklace (lyra), ledger (strings), letter (full theme). When Clio speaks: a new melody. Gentle. Hopeful. The sound of the future. On the return: the ghost's theme hummed over water, resolving into peace.

---

### SCENE 12 — Η ΝΕΑ ΕΠΟΧΗ (The New Era)

*Weeks later. The harbor of Galaxidi at sunset. The whole town gathered — fishermen, taverna owners, old women in black, children. Chairs and benches form an amphitheater facing the water. Akis stands with a camera on a tripod. A projection screen flickers to life against the old harbor wall.*

**Story beats**:
1. Ntemis stands before the gathered Galaxidians. The treasure chest sits open on a table — the gold coins gleam, the αλληλασφάλεια ledger open beside them. The jade necklace around Clio's neck.
2. Ntemis: "Ο Βισβίκης δεν μας άφησε θησαυρό. Μας άφησε ερώτηση. Τι κάνεις όταν ο κόσμος αλλάζει κι εσύ αγαπάς αυτό που ήταν;"
3. He turns to Akis: "Ο Άκης ξέρει να κρατάει ιστορίες ζωντανές. Το έκανε στην Άμφισσα. Θα το κάνει και για το Γαλαξίδι."
4. Akis steps forward. He's not just a musician — he's a documentarist. His camera has told the stories of dying towns and living traditions. Amfissa, the mountain villages, the olive groves. Now, Galaxidi.
5. Akis: "Τριάντα χρόνια κινηματογραφώ τόπους που σβήνουν. Το Γαλαξίδι δεν θα σβήσει. Αυτή τη φορά δεν γράφω ελεγείο. Γράφω αρχή."
6. He plays a clip on the screen — test footage he's already shot. The harbor at dawn. Chrysostomos on the Ελπίδα. The cave mouth. Old hands mending nets. The carved ships on gravestones. The town gasps at its own beauty seen through fresh eyes.
7. Athos stands. The lawyer in him has been working: "Ο χρυσός θα χρηματοδοτήσει τρία πράγματα. Το ντοκιμαντέρ. Την αποκατάσταση του μουσείου. Και κάτι καινούριο."
8. Ntemis takes over — the vision. He speaks carefully, the way he always does, but with fire underneath:
9. Ntemis: "Οι καπεταναίοι αρνήθηκαν τον ατμό. Δεν θα κάνουμε το ίδιο λάθος. Το ατμόπλοιο σήμερα λέγεται τεχνητή νοημοσύνη. Αλλάζει τα πάντα — τη δουλειά, τις πόλεις, τον τρόπο ζωής."
10. Ajax, from the crowd: "Και τι γίνεται με μέρη σαν εδώ;" — He's asking Athos's question back. Full circle.
11. Ntemis: "Αυτό είναι το μυστικό. Σε έναν κόσμο που τρέχει, τα μέρη που αναπνέουν γίνονται ο νέος παράδεισος. Το Γαλαξίδι δεν χρειάζεται να γίνει σαν την Αθήνα. Χρειάζεται να γίνει περισσότερο Γαλαξίδι."
12. Murmur in the crowd. Chrysostomos nods from his chair. The Curator's eyes are wet.
13. Ntemis: "Η αλληλασφάλεια ήταν 104 υπογραφές. Σήμερα ζητάω τις δικές σας. Όχι για καράβια. Για κάτι μεγαλύτερο — να κάνουμε αυτό τον τόπο ζωντανό ξανά. Με τον δικό μας τρόπο."
14. Silence. Then the old woman in black — the same one who nodded at them on arrival in Scene 1 — stands first. She walks to the ledger and signs. One by one, the Galaxidians follow. Akis films it all.
15. Stathis picks up his guitar. Akis puts down his camera and picks up his φλογέρα. The sailors' melody from Scene 3 — but now the whole harbor hums along. Not a lament anymore. A beginning.
16. Clio draws in her notebook: the harbor, the crowd, the screen, the signatures. She writes one word underneath: **ΕΛΠΙΔΑ**.
17. Ajax: "Μπαμπά, πόσες υπογραφές;" Ntemis counts. "Εκατόν τρεις. Λείπει μία." Ajax grabs the pen and signs. "Εκατόν τέσσερις." The same number as the original pact.

**Gameplay**: Walk through crowd (talk to familiar NPCs — each has a reaction line). Approach podium → Ntemis speech sequence. Watch documentary clip (cinematic). Athos presents the plan. Ntemis delivers the vision. Interactive signing sequence — watch townspeople approach the ledger one by one. Ajax signs last (104th). Clio notebook moment. Sailors' melody plays. Credits tease.

**Music**: Builds from silence. Ntemis's speech is unscored — just the crowd, the sea, the wind. Documentary clip has its own underscore (Akis's footage theme — warm, cinematic). When the old woman signs: a single guitar note. Each signature adds a layer. By the time Ajax signs the 104th: the full sailors' melody with φλογέρα, guitar, lyra, strings — the richest arrangement in the game. The theme of Galaxidi reborn.

### EPILOGUE

*Ο Καπετάν Βισβίκης ταξίδεψε στην Ανατολή, γύρισε πλούσιος, κι έκρυψε τον θησαυρό του για κάποιον που θα αγαπούσε το Γαλαξίδι αρκετά για να τον βρει.*

*Εκατόν είκοσι χρόνια αργότερα, τρεις ταξιδιώτες τον βρήκαν.*

*Οι παλιοί καπεταναίοι αρνήθηκαν τον ατμό. Οι νέοι δεν θα κάνουν το ίδιο λάθος.*

*Σε έναν κόσμο που αλλάζει πιο γρήγορα απ' ό,τι μπορεί κανείς να φανταστεί, τα μέρη που θυμούνται ποιοι είναι γίνονται ο νέος παράδεισος.*

*Εκατόν τέσσερις υπογραφές. Τότε και τώρα.*

*Η θάλασσα θυμάται. Κι εμείς τώρα, αλλάζουμε μαζί της.*

**ΤΟ ΜΥΣΤΗΡΙΟ ΤΟΥ ΓΑΛΑΞΕΙΔΙΟΥ**

*Κράτα την αλληλεγγύη. Άλλαξε το πλοίο.*

## Dialog Guidelines

### Tone
- Warm, never sarcastic. These characters love each other.
- Mystery is gentle, not threatening. Wonder, not danger.
- Greek dialog should sound natural — everyday family speech, not literary.
- Humor comes from character (Clio's deadpan logic, Ajax's enthusiasm, Ntemis's quiet reactions).

### Per-Character Voice

| Character | Style | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Ntemis** | Calm, reflective, gentle | "Ας κοιτάξουμε πιο προσεκτικά." |
| **Ajax** | Excited, questions, action | "Τέλειο! Πάμε αμέσως!" / "Σοβαρά τώρα;" |
| **Clio** | Observant, deadpan, wise | "Σας. Το. Είπα." |
| **Narrator** | Descriptive, atmospheric | "Ο ήλιος βάφει χρυσά τα καλντερίμια." |
| **Akis** | Warm, knowing, musical | "Αν ψάχνεις για τον Βισβίκη, πρέπει να δεις το μουσείο. Εκεί ζει η ιστορία." |
| **Stathis** | Easy-going, poetic, nostalgic | "Ήταν το τραγούδι των ναυτικών. Το τραγουδούσαν όταν έφευγαν." |
| **Curator** | Passionate, educational, fast | "Ακριβώς, μικρέ μου. Ακριβώς αυτό." / "Περιμένετε, υπάρχει κι άλλο." |
| **Athos** | Sharp, precise, lawyerly warmth | "Μη με ρωτήσεις αν αξίζεις. Πήγαινε και δείξ' το." |
| **Giannis** | Quiet, observant, few words | "Ξέρεις γιατί αγόρασα τον μύλο; Γιατί από εδώ βλέπεις τα πάντα." |
| **Papas** | Warm, mischievous, resonant | "ΟΧΙ στις εικόνες!" / "Παιδί μου, ο Θεός και η θάλασσα κανένα δεν σε ρωτάει αν είσαι έτοιμος." |
| **Chrysostomos** | Old sailor, poetic, steady | "Η Ελπίδα ξέρει τον δρόμο. Εγώ απλά κρατάω το τιμόνι." |

### Dialog Rules
- Max 2 sentences per speech bubble
- Narrator describes, characters react
- Children should sound like children (but smart ones)
- Important revelations get their own dialog beat (pause before/after)

## Puzzle Design Principles

1. **Logical** — every puzzle makes sense in context
2. **Character-driven** — each family member contributes (Ajax climbs/reaches/digs, Clio observes/reads/draws, Ntemis reads/deduces/connects)
3. **Progressive** — teach mechanics early, combine later
4. **No dead ends** — player can always progress (no pixel hunting)
5. **Rewarding** — puzzles reveal story, not just unlock doors

## Puzzle Chain (Visvikis Treasure Hunt)

```
Scene 2 (house): open shutters → find locked drawer → key in pot → Visvikis's letter (quest hook)
Scene 3 (harbor): reunion with Akis & Stathis → Akis tells Visvikis legend + points to museum, Stathis points to Athos
Scene 4 (museum): curator explains golden age + decline → learn αλληλασφάλεια history
Scene 5 (liotrivi): Athos confirms cave, reveals will → challenges family ("ατμόπλοιο σήμερα;")
Scene 6 (windmill): Giannis shows cave entrance from above → gives brass LANTERN
Scene 7 (cave): Ajax climbs, discovers "9 to 3" VOTE inscription → Clio finds GREEN STONE (jade)
Scene 8 (graveyard): place stone on Visvikis's grave → GHOST appears → points to church
Scene 9 (church): candle scene → Clio finds floor tile "Λ.Β." → NAUTICAL CHART (X marks Agios Georgios)
Scene 10 (boat): Chrysostomos on the Ελπίδα crosses to island → find rock → cross → 5 steps → dig
Scene 11 (treasure): open chest → gold + jade necklace + αλληλασφάλεια ledger + final letter
Scene 12 (harbor): Ntemis's speech → Akis's documentary → new αλληλασφάλεια signing → 104 signatures again
```
