# Το Μυστήριο του Γαλαξειδίου — Story Bible

## Logline

A father and his two children arrive in Galaxidi for a quiet weekend — but a mysterious stranger, an ancient secret, and the sea itself have other plans.

## Theme

**"The sea remembers what people forget."** — Memory, family bonds, the living history of a place. The treasure isn't gold — it's understanding who you are through where you come from.

## Setting

**Galaxidi (Γαλαξίδι)**, Corinthian Gulf, Greece. Late September 2026. End of summer — golden light, warm stone, the sea impossibly blue. A town that was once the greatest shipbuilding port in Greece, now a quiet fishing village that holds its secrets close.

## Characters

### Ntemis (Ντέμης) — The Father
- Calm, warm, thoughtful. Sees beauty in small things.
- Knows Galaxidi from childhood summers but hasn't been back in years.
- Doesn't realize the weekend trip was "arranged" until events unfold.

### Ajax (Αίαντας) — The Son
- Energetic, curious, brave. Always wants to explore.
- Asks questions about everything. First to volunteer for adventure.
- "Μπαμπά, πάμε!" is his catchphrase.
- Can reach small spaces (gameplay mechanic).

### Clio (Κλειώ) — The Daughter
- Observant, creative, wise beyond her years. Named after the Muse of History.
- Reads ancient Greek (gameplay mechanic — can decipher inscriptions).
- Notices details others miss. The emotional heart of the story.
- "Κοιτάξτε..." is her catchphrase — she's always pointing out what matters.

### The Stranger "Γ." — The Mystery
- Known only by the initial "Γ." (Gamma).
- Left the satchel with the note. Knows the family is coming.
- An old man at the port who knows the sea's secrets.
- Reveal: **Γιώργος** — an old friend of Ntemis's late father, who promised to pass on a secret "when the time came." The time is now because the family house is about to be sold.

   - Clio: "Αυτά δεν είναι σχέδια... είναι αναμνήσεις."
   - The cave walls show the history of Galaxidi's sailors.
3. **Deep chamber** — A natural pool. The dolphins from the harbor are here.
   - In the water: a sealed amphora. Inside: Ntemis's father's journal.
   - The journal: letters to Ntemis. Memories of their summers together.
   - "Ο αληθινός θησαυρός δεν είναι χρυσός. Είναι αυτό που θυμάσαι."
4. **Hilltop epilogue** — Sunrise. The family watches the sea together.
   - Ntemis reads a passage to the children.

- Find amphora in pool → get journal
- Read journal → triggers ending sequence

## Dialog Guidelines

### Tone
- Warm, never sarcastic. These characters love each other.
- Mystery is gentle, not threatening. Wonder, not danger.
- Greek dialog should sound natural — everyday family speech, not literary.

### Per-Character Voice

| Character | Style | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Ntemis** | Calm, reflective, gentle | "Ας κοιτάξουμε πιο προσεκτικά." |
| **Ajax** | Excited, questions, action | "Τέλειο! Πάμε αμέσως!" |
| **Clio** | Observant, poetic, wise | "Κοιτάξτε... σαν να μας περιμένει." |
| **Narrator** | Descriptive, atmospheric | "Ο ήλιος βάφει χρυσά τα καλντερίμια." |
| **Γιώργος** | Old, warm, slightly cryptic | "Ο πατέρας σου... ήξερε να ακούει τη θάλασσα." |

### Dialog Rules
- Max 2 sentences per speech bubble
- Narrator describes, characters react
- Children should sound like children (but smart ones)
- Important revelations get their own dialog beat (pause before/after)

## Puzzle Design Principles

1. **Logical** — every puzzle should make sense in context
2. **Character-driven** — use each family member's strengths
3. **Progressive** — teach mechanics early, combine later
4. **No dead ends** — player can always progress (no pixel hunting)
5. **Rewarding** — puzzles reveal story, not just unlock doors

## Emotional Arc

```
Act 1: Wonder (arrival) → Curiosity (note) → Excitement (let's go!)
Act 2: Discovery (meeting Γ.) → Connection (father's story) → Determination (find the cave)
Act 3: Awe (the cave) → Emotion (the journal) → Peace (the sunrise)
```
