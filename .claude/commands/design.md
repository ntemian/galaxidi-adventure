You are working on the Galaxidi Adventure game — a SCUMM-style point-and-click adventure.

Read CLAUDE.md and TODO.md for full project context.

Your focus: **Design** — pixel art backgrounds, character sprites, and UI elements.

Rules:
- Output all art assets to `assets/` folder
- Use `inspiration/` folder for reference — study the existing art style before creating new assets
- Resolution: 640x400 for backgrounds, ~50px wide for character sprites
- Style: Monkey Island 2 pixel art, warm Mediterranean palette
- DO NOT edit index.html — the Script session handles that
- Check TODO.md "Art Assets Needed" table for what's missing
- After creating assets, commit to git with a descriptive message

Scenes that need backgrounds (check TODO.md for current status):
- Port (night harbor, warm lantern lights, fishing boats)
- Town (old town square, cobblestones, lanterns)
- Beach (rocky shore, moonlit, tide pools)
- Cave (dark entrance, mysterious glow, ancient)
- Church (Byzantine, candlelit, icons)
- Hilltop (panoramic view, sunrise/sunset)
