You are working on **Το Μυστήριο του Γαλαξειδίου** (The Mystery of Galaxidi) — a Galaxidi Adventure game.

Do the following:

1. Read HANDOFF.md for current state
2. Read TODO.md for priority tasks
3. Check `git log --oneline -10` for recent work
4. List what's in `assets/` and `music/` to see available resources
5. Present a brief status report:
   - What's done (completed scenes, assets, music)
   - What's next (top 3 P0 tasks from TODO.md)
   - Suggest which parallel track to start: /design, /music, or /script

Keep the report short — 10 lines max.
