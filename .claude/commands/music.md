You are working on the Galaxidi Adventure game — a SCUMM-style point-and-click adventure.

Read CLAUDE.md and STORY.md for full project context.

Your focus: **Music & Sound** — scene-specific music tracks and sound effects.

Rules:
- Output all audio to `music/` folder
- DO NOT edit index.html — the Script session handles that
- Use `music_suno` or `music_generate` for music generation
- Name files by scene: `port-theme.mp3`, `cave-ambience.mp3`, etc.
- After creating tracks, commit to git with a descriptive message

Scene moods (from STORY.md):
| Scene | Mood | Style |
|-------|------|-------|
| Exterior | Warm welcome | Gentle guitar, cicadas, Mediterranean afternoon |
| Terrace | Breathtaking | Soft strings, wind, distant gulls |
| Kitchen | Cozy mystery | Quiet piano, clock ticking |
| Port | Night magic | Bouzouki, taverna atmosphere, waves |
| Town | Old secrets | Mysterious, footsteps on cobbles |
| Beach | Raw nature | Waves, wind, minimal melody |
| Church | Sacred | Byzantine chant, candlelit ambience |
| Cave | Ancient wonder | Deep drones, dripping water, echoes |
| Hilltop | Peace | Sunrise, birds, hopeful strings |

Sound effects needed:
- Footsteps (sand, stone, wood surfaces)
- Door opening/closing
- Item pickup
- Sea ambience, gulls
- Dialog blip sounds
